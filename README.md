# EA_Assessment
In this repository I am going to store some work I have done for EA's hiring process.

The repository stores the three notebooks with the exploratory analysis, the classification task and the topic modeling. In addition you can find the html results of topic extraction.
Finally you can also find the requirements.txt file in order to reproduce the virtual environment used for this experiments.
